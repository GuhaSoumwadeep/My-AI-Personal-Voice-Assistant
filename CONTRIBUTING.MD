# How to contribute
Contributing to this repository is quite simple and I hope whoever wants to, can do it in the easiest way possible. Below mentioned are some of the rules you should follow and you're good to go.

## Step Zero
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account üç¥
- Clone the repo to your local machine:  ``` $ git clone "repo_url" ``` 

## Step One (Make Changes)
- Look for bugs or mentions provided in the issue, comment to work on it.
- If you want to mention your own issue, you're welcome to do so and work on that. Describe the issue in detail and how you want to resolve a bug or add a feature.
- Make sure to stick to the coding convention that is used already in the project.

## Step Two (Submit Changes)
- After successfully making changes in the project in your local system, create a new branch ```$ git checkout -b "branch_name"``` ***Your branch name should be your username.*** (Always avoid working directly on the master branch to keep your PR safe from getting rejected)
- Add the files in git: ```$ git add .``` (***'add space .' means to add all the files that are changed or added in the project.***)
- Commit the changes: ```$ git commit -m "your commit message"``` ***Commit message should contain the changes you did in the project.***
- Create a Pull Request: ```$ git push origin "your_branch_name"``` That's it.

After successfully making a PR, add yourself in the **Contributors** section in README.md file
